# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# AdminUser.create(email: 'admin@example.com', password: 'password', password_confirmation: 'password') if Rails.env.development?

# team = Team.create(team_id: '202011', team_name: 'Team_1')

# for i in 1..5 do
#     team.students.create(
#         email: "student_#{i}@example.com", 
#         password: "student_#{i}", 
#         password_confirmation: "student_#{i}",
#         student_id: "V00000#{i}",
#         name: "Student_#{i}",
#         github_id: "github.com/student_#{i}" 
#     )
